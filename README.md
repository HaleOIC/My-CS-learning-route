# My CS learning route
I'm an undergraduate student majored in Computer Science in Huazhong university of science and technolegy. Tired of the boring courses, I began self-learning totally after my fresh year. This repository contains all the resources I used to self-learning. The links below will take you either to another repository which contains my solution for homework and course projects or to the course website where you can get full guidance. 

If you find this repo helpful for you, your 🌟 is the best gift for me ~ 



## Programming Basics :artificial_satellite:

There are many programming courses for freshman, I find all of them interesting !

#### MIT missing-semester 

Just as the course name indicated, this course will teach the missing things in the university courses. It will cover shell programming, git, vim editor, tmux, ssh, sed, awk and even how to beatify your terminal. Trust me, this will be your first step to become a hacker ! 

------

#### SICP

At the beginning, I wanted to learn this course because I knew there was such a course in my freshman year. The main thing I learned was mental skills, but I was very impetuous at that time. I wanted to realize the so-called hard skills as soon as possible, so I chose the front-end as my main direction. After studying for a period of time, in the daily learning process, it is very important to discover the characteristics of the language itself, and I have heard about how to design a programming language for a long time, and I really want to learn the specific situation.

#### Data structure in Python 

This is not a very difficult textbook. He will tell how the basic data structure is designed, but I did learn a lot of skills about using python from this book. At first, it was to prepare for the Lanqiao Cup for transfering language. In the end, it was true that in that year, Group A of the Lanqiao Cup College Students I won the third national prize.

#### Nand2Tetris

This course got 5.0 full score on coursera ! It is divided into two part : hardware part and software part.

Hardware part : you will use Nand gates to implement all the components (ALU, Memory, Decoder, Mutiplexer ... ...) of a running computer. In the end you will implement a CPU to run your machine code.

Software part : The author created a new language called Jack. You will write the compiler to translate the Jack code into your machine code and run it on the computer you made in the hardware part. Then you will implement a basic OS to do the input and output. Finally you can write a Tetris game in Jack and play it on the computer you made ! It is so coolllllll !

#### CMU 15213: CSAPP

This course is so well-known and I don't believe that you haven't heard about it before. My major introduces some parts of the course in the microcomputer principle,its official website has all the materials for you to complete the course. You can find course videos on Bilibili or Youtube. 

When I finished It, I may have more thinkings and feellings for the course.

#### 0.Assembly Languge

It is a very interesting course, although It is not about the RISC or CISC,But it truly explains the basic principle of assembly language and It can has very great related files and you can even write the codes word by word to understand why this need is needed when the course is going on!

The teacher may not be very famous, but he is not as the comments said so awful, I think he is a good teacher!

------

#### 1. Computer networking 

In the fall 2020, the authors of this wonderful book (A Top Down Approach) released his teaching videos online which you can use to supplement your learning. In its labs, you will use wireshark to catch real network packet to understand how each protocol works.

The Stanford course is much harder and you can also find its teaching videos on Youtube or Bilibili. In its labs you will implement the TCP, Network Interface, IP routing and put them together to talk with other peers on the Internet. Sounds cool right? (a sad story: the labs are time-consuming, personally I spent 5-6 hours per lab on average).
